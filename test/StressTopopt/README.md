# GCMMA-MMA-Julia

The Julia code provided in this respository implements the Method of Moving Asymptotes (Svanberg, 1987), which is based on the GCMMA-MMA-code originally written by Prof. Krister Svanberg for MATLAB. 
The original code can be obtained from http://www.smoptit.se/ and is distributed under the GNU General Public License.   

If you choose to download and use this code, Prof. Krister Svanberg kindly requests that you send him an email, mentioning your identity and explaining your intended usage of the code. You can find his email address on his website: https://people.kth.se/~krille/.   

When publishing your work that incorporates this code, it is important to acknowledge the academic contributions of Prof. Krister Svanberg by referencing his original work. The appropriate references can be found below.
